publishing.txt

These are my personal notes on testing and publishing this extension.
They are mainly for my personal reference but possibly of use to someone
else helping out with development activities.

Packaging
---------

To package the extension for local testing, make sure the version has
been bumped in package.json, then in a COMMAND PROMPT window (the
tools do not work from a cygwin window):

  D:\wrk\vscode\default-keys-windows>set PATH=%PATH%;d:\opt\node-v14.18.0

  D:\wrk\vscode\default-keys-windows>node %APPDATA%\npm\node_modules\vsce\out\vsce package
   DONE  Packaged: D:\wrk\vscode\default-keys-windows\default-keys-windows-0.0.5.vsix (14 files, 116.85KB)

Local Testing
-------------

Copy the VSIX file to the Linux test VM.

On the Linux VM, open the Extensions area via button on left edge, then
choose "Install from VSIX ..." from the "..." menu.  Choose the VSIX file
then restart VSCode.

Check that the new bindings appear in the key bindings list and work in
the editor.  The main one I test with is Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Down, which on
Windows creates a multi-line column selection.  Without this extension,
on Linux it would instead duplicate the current line, but with this
extension, also creates a multi-line column selection.

Beware: Some Linux desktop environments eat these key combinations!
I recently upgraded to Mint 20.1 and found I needed to run:

  $ gsettings set org.cinnamon.desktop.keybindings.wm move-to-workspace-down "['']"
  $ gsettings set org.cinnamon.desktop.keybindings.wm move-to-workspace-up "['']"

in order to allow VSCode to see these combinations.

Publishing
----------

Make sure version has been bumped in package.json and an entry added to
CHANGELOG.md.

Log in to https://dev.azure.com/smcpeak/ with MS credentials.
Go to User Settings (top right), Personal Access Tokens.
Click New Token.
Give it a name like "token-2020-05-18".
Set Organization to "All accessible organizations".
Ensure scope is "Custom defined".
Click "Show all scopes".
Scroll down to "Marketplace" and check "Acquire" and "Manage".
Click "Create".
Copy to clipboard, save to a file.
Close window with the token.

At the COMMAND PROMPT window:

  D:\wrk\vscode\default-keys-windows>node %APPDATA%\npm\node_modules\vsce\out\vsce publish -p <token>

where <token> is the actual token (paste with Ctrl+V).

Test Installation from Marketplace
----------------------------------

Check that the new version is visible at
https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=smcpeak.default-keys-windows

Go to Linux test VM.
Uninstall the version that was installed from VSIX.
Restart VSCode.
In extensions, search for "Windows Default Keybindings".
Should see new version there.
Install and test with Ctrl+Shift+Alt+Down.

Publish on Github
-----------------

Tag and push, e.g.:

  $ git tag v0.0.5
  $ git push
  $ git push --tags

Go to Releases:
https://github.com/smcpeak/vscode-default-keys-windows/releases

Draft new release, name like vscode-default-keys-windows-0.0.5.
Select tag.
Copy CHANGELOG.md fragment.
Attach VSIX file.
Publish.

Publish on open-vsx
-------------------

Instructions: https://github.com/eclipse/openvsx/wiki/Publishing-Extensions

Command to publish:

  $ npx ovsx publish default-keys-windows-0.0.5.vsix -p <token>

where <token> is an access token I might have already in a file, otherwise
need to log in to using Github OAuth at https://open-vsx.org to create a
token.
